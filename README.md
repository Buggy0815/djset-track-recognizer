This is a repo you can use to identify which songs were played in a
soundcloud dj-set. (probably it's gonna work also for youtube and mixcloud
but i didn't try it yet)

first install the requirements by using

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then go to the Example.ipynb file and specify the dj-set by passing the
corresponding url and run the notebook. Have fun! It doesn't work a 100% because
Shazam doesn't know any existing song.
